	<h1 align="center"> 6 Suprising Benefit of Regularly Donating Blood That Every Malaysian Should Know </h2>
	</div>
	<div class="smallblock">
	<h5> Ever wonder why are we always encouraged to donate blood?
	That’s because the blood stored in the National Blood Centre doesn’t last long. 
	Red blood cells can only last for 35 days at most, 
	while platelets can only be kept for up to five days. <br><br> 
	If saving lives isn’t a big enough incentive for you to donate blood, 
	did you know that blood donors are eligible for other benefits as well? 
	Here are some of the benefits you can enjoy if you donate blood regularly! <br><br>
	<ol>
		<b><li>You can check your basic health stats for FREE</li></b><br>
		<img src="images/1.jpg" style="width:600px;height:320px;" class="center">
		<br><p>Right before you donate blood, the staff will check your health by checking your pulse rate, 
		blood pressure and iron level. This is part of the procedure to determine that you are healthy enough to donate blood. 
		But it never harms you to know how well do you do in terms of some basic health conditions since many people don’t go for medical checkups regularly.</p>
		
		<b><li>Donating blood can reduce the risk of heart and liver diseases</li></b><br>
		<img src="images/2.jpg" style="width:600px;height:320px;" class="center">
		<br><p>People with high iron levels are prone to heart, liver and pancreatic diseases due to excess iron stored in your body. 
		By donating blood, the iron level in your blood will be balanced out, BRMS Online says. 
		It also stimulates your body to produce new blood cells to replenish the blood that has been donated.</p>
		
		<b><li>Weight loss</li></b><br>
		<img src="images/3.jpg" style="width:600px;height:320px;" class="center">
		<br><p>Each donation burns around 650 calories, which is equivalent to a 30-minute run. 
		But don’t treat it as a way to lose weight because that’s not healthy. 
		You need at least a three-month break before the next blood donation. 
		Still, at least you get to burn some extra calories.</p>

		<p><br>Depending on your frequency of blood donation, you are eligible for several medical benefits such as free Hepatitis B vaccination 
		and outpatient treatment at any government hospital. It’s for free! You deserve it!</p>
		
		<b><li>Reduce the risk of heart attack</li></b><br>
		<img src="images/5.jpg" style="width:600px;height:320px;" class="center">
		<br><p>A study conducted by the American Journal of Epidemiology says that donating blood helps to reduce the risk of a heart attack by 88%, 
		which is a lot! This is related to the high levels of iron in your blood, which can constrict your blood vessels. 
		This creates more risk of a heart attack and lesser iron in your blood gives your vessels more room.</p>
		
		<b><li>Lesser risk of developing cancer</li></b><br>
		<img src="images/6.jpg" style="width:600px;height:320px;" class="center">
		<br><p>Again, this is connected to the lesser amount of iron in your blood after you donate. 
		Research shows that there is a reduced risk of cancer for blood donors with different illnesses, 
		such as hemochromatosis. The Journal of the National Cancer Institute says that this iron-reduction method is associated with 
		lower cancer risk especially for people with Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD).</p>
